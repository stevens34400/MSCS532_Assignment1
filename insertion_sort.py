def insertion_sort_desc(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array in descending order using the insertion sort algorithm.
    
    Algorithm: Build the final sorted array one item at a time. Each iteration
    takes an element from the unsorted part and inserts it into its correct
    position in the sorted part.
    
    Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) - worst and average case
    Space Complexity: O(1) - in-place sorting
    
    Args:
        arr (list): The array to be sorted
        
    Returns:
        list: The sorted array in descending order
